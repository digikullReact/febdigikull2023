/*

1. **Basic Importing**:
   - You have a file named `mathTools.js` that exports a function named `add`. How would you import the `add` function into another file called `app.js`?

2. **Exporting Multiple Functions**:
   - You've written two functions in `stringTools.js`: `toUpperCase` and `toLowerCase`. How would you export both functions so they can be imported into another module?

3. **Using Built-in Modules**:
   - Which built-in Node.js module allows you to interact with the file system, and how would you use it to read the content of a file named `data.txt`?

4. **Module Properties**:
   - Every module in Node.js has access to an object named `module`. Which property of this object provides information about the current module's file, and how would you use it to log the filename (without the full path) of the current module?
